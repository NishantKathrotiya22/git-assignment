        <ul>
            <li>Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously.
                It
                tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple people.</li>
            <li>Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that every user has a complete copy of the
                repository,
                including its history. This allows users to work offline and commit changes locally before pushing them
                to a
                shared repository.</li>
            <li>Git uses a branching model that allows users to create branches for different features or experiments.
                This
                enables parallel development and makes it easy to merge changes back into the main branch when they are
                ready.</li>
            <li>Git tracks changes using a system of commits, which are snapshots of the project at a specific point in
                time. Each commit has a unique identifier and contains information about the changes made, the author,
                and a
                commit message describing the changes.</li>
            <li>Git also supports collaboration through pull requests, which allow users to propose changes to a
                repository.
                Other users can review the changes, discuss them, and merge them into the main branch if they are
                approved.
            </li>
            <li>Overall, Git is a powerful tool for managing code and collaborating on software projects. It provides a
                robust framework for version control, enabling teams to work together efficiently and effectively.</li>
        </ul>
